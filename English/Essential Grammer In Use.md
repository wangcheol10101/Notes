## Infinitive (不定式)

**Finite VS Infinitive**
- “finite” verbs are those that are limited by person, number, tense, and mood (e.g., I walk, she walks, they walked).
- The infinitive, by contrast, is not tied to a subject or specific time—it’s “unlimited.” It doesn’t change form based on who is doing the action or when it happens.

**Functions of Infinitive Clauses**
- As Subjects  
    > To travel the world has always been her dream.  
- As Subject Complements  
    > Her goal is to become a doctor.  
    > The best thing would be to apologize.  
- As Direct Objects  
    > I want to learn Spanish.  
    > She promised to help us.
- As Object Complements  
    > We elected him to lead the team.  
    > I heard her sing a song. (bare infinitive)  
- As Adjectives (Post-modifiers)   
    > She has a book to read.  
    > Is there anything to eat?  
    These modify nouns and usually answer “which one?” or “what for?”
- As Adverbs (Expressing Purpose or Reason)  
    > He went to the store to buy milk. (purpose)  
    > She studied hard to pass the exam.  
    This is often replaceable with “in order to.”

## Gerunds(动名词)

A gerund is a verb form that ends in -ing and functions as a **noun** in a sentence.(Gerunds can do anything a noun can do)

> Her favorite hobby is painting. (subject complement)

**Gerund with a Possessive (or Object) Noun/Pronoun**

> I appreciate your helping me. ✅ (formal/correct)  
> I appreciate you helping me. ✅ (common in informal speech)  
> His singing was amazing. ✅ (formal/correct)	  
> He singing was amazing. ✅ (common in informal speech)

**When You Can Omit the Relative Pronoun**  
You can omit it when it’s the **object** of the relative clause.  
> The book (that) I bought is good.  
> The man (who) I met was kind.  

**Prepositions in Relative Clauses**  
- Formal (with relative pronoun at front)  
    > The person to whom I spoke was kind.

## Participle  
A participle is a verb form used as an **adjective (to describe a noun)** or as part of a verb phrase.  
- Present participle
    -ing form  
    shows ongoing action or describes nouns  
- Past participle
    usually -ed, -en, or irregular form  
    shows completed action or describes nouns  

**Uses of Participles**
- As part of a verb phrase  
- As adjectives  
    > The crying baby is hungry.  
    > The broken window needs repair.  
- As participial phrases  
    These describe or **add information about a noun or about the whole sentence**.  
    > Walking down the street, I saw a friend.  
    > Tired from work, he went straight to bed.  
    ⚠️ Important: The subject of the participial phrase must be the same as the subject of the main clause.  

**Gerund vs. Present Participle**  
Ask:
→ “Is it being used as a thing (noun)?” → Gerund
→ “Is it being used to describe something or as a tense?” → Participle

## Prepositional phrase
A prepositional phrase is a group of words that:  
- begins with a preposition (like in, on, at, by, with, from, about, after, before, etc.)  
- and ends with the **object of the preposition** (a noun, pronoun, or noun phrase).  
> in the morning → “in” (preposition) + “the morning” (object)  

A prepositional phrase functions as either:  
- an adjective (modifying a noun), or  
- an adverb (modifying a verb, adjective, or another adverb).  

- As an Adjective Phrase  
    Noun + [Prepositional phrase] = expanded noun phrase.  
    Describes or gives more information about a noun.  
    > The book on the table is mine.  
- As an Adverb Phrase
    Verb + [Prepositional phrase] = more detail about the action.  
    Describes where, when, how, or why something happens (modifies a verb).  
    > He spoke with great confidence.  
    > They left because of the rain.

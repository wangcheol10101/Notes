## Infinitive Clause(不定式)

**Finite VS Infinitive**
- “finite” verbs are those that are limited by person, number, tense, and mood (e.g., I walk, she walks, they walked).
- The infinitive, by contrast, is not tied to a subject or specific time—it’s “unlimited.” It doesn’t change form based on who is doing the action or when it happens.

**Functions of Infinitive Clauses**
- As Subjects  
    > To travel the world has always been her dream.
- As Subject Complements  
    > Her goal is to become a doctor.  
    > The best thing would be to apologize.
- As Direct Objects  
    > I want to learn Spanish.  
    > She promised to help us.
- As Object Complements  
    > We elected him to lead the team.  
    > I heard her sing a song. (bare infinitive)
- As Adjectives (Post-modifiers)   
    > She has a book to read.  
    > Is there anything to eat?  
    These modify nouns and usually answer “which one?” or “what for?”
- As Adverbs (Expressing Purpose or Reason)  
    > He went to the store to buy milk. (purpose)  
    > She studied hard to pass the exam.  
    This is often replaceable with “in order to.”

## Gerunds(动名词)

A gerund is a verb form that ends in -ing and functions as a noun in a sentence.(Gerunds can do anything a noun can do)  

> Swimming is good exercise. (subject)

**Gerund with a Possessive (or Object) Noun/Pronoun**

> I appreciate you helping me. ✅ (common in informal speech)  
> His singing was amazing. ✅ (formal/correct)	  
> He singing was amazing. ✅ (common in informal speech)

## Types of Verb Complements  
Verb complements are categorized based on what kind of verb they follow (action verbs or linking verbs) and what function they serve.  
- Direct Object  
    This follows a transitive action verb.  
    > She kicked the ball.  
- Indirect Object  
    > He gave **me** a gift.  
- Subject Complement  
    This follows a linking verb (like is, become, seem, smell). It describes or renames the subject of the sentence.  
    > He is a teacher.(Renames the subject.)  
    > He seems tired.(Describes the subject.)  
- Object Complement  
    This follows a Direct Object and adds more information about that object (renaming it or describing its state).  
    > They elected him president. (Renames the object "him.")  
    > The news made her sad. (Describes the state of the object "her.")  
- Prepositional Complement(Prepositional Object)  
    Some verbs act as a unit with a specific preposition. These are often called prepositional verbs.  
    > She listened to the music.  
    > I agree with you.  
    Some linguists consider "rely on" to be a single phrasal verb unit (a **transitive multi-word verb**). If analyzed that way, "me" would be the Direct Object. However, in standard sentence analysis, "on me" is a Prepositional Complement.  

## Infinitive (不定式)  

**Finite VS Infinitive**
- “finite” verbs are those that are limited by person, number, tense, and mood (e.g., I walk, she walks, they walked).
- The infinitive, by contrast, is not tied to a subject or specific time—it’s “unlimited.” It doesn’t change form based on who is doing the action or when it happens.

**Functions of Infinitive Clauses**  
- As Subjects  
    > To travel the world has always been her dream.  
- As Subject Complements  
    > Her goal is to become a doctor.  
    > The best thing would be to apologize.  
- As Direct Objects  
    > I want to learn Spanish.  
    > She promised to help us.  
- As Verb Complements  
    Common verbs that take infinitive clauses as complements   
    - Desire/intention  
        want, wish, hope, plan, intend, decide  
        > I want to go.  
    - Promise/offer/refuse  
        promise, agree, refuse, offer  
        > She agreed to help.  
    - Attempt/effort  
        try, attempt, fail, manage  
        > He tried to open the door.  
    - Perception or mental state  
        expect, believe, know, remember  
        > I expect to see her soon.  
    - Communication  
        ask, tell, advise, persuade (+ object)  
        > He told me to wait.  
- As Adjective Complements  
    > I’m happy to see you.  
- As Object Complements  
    > We elected him to lead the team.  
    > I heard her sing a song. (bare infinitive)  
- As Adjectives (Post-modifiers)   
    > She has a book to read.  
    > Is there anything to eat?  
    These modify nouns and usually answer “which one?” or “what for?”
- As Adverbs (Expressing Purpose or Reason)  
    > He went to the store to buy milk. (purpose)  
    > She studied hard to pass the exam.  
    This is often replaceable with “in order to.”  
    > They make the argument easier **to follow**. (adverbial function of modifying the adjective)  
- Free-standing infinitive phrase used adverbially  
    functions as an adverbial expression of purpose or comment on the act of speaking/writing.  
    > To repeat, this approach is not recommended.  
    > To be clear, I didn’t mean that.  

**Types of Infinitive Clauses**  
- Full (To-) Infinitive Clauses  
    Most common form: to + base verb  
    > I plan to call her tomorrow.  
- Bare Infinitive Clauses  
    Used after:  
    - Causative verbs: make, let, have  
        > She made me laugh.  
    - Perception verbs: see, hear, feel, watch, notice  
        > <ins>I saw him leave.</ins>  
    - Modal verbs: can, could, will, would, shall, should, may, might, must  
        > You must go now.  
    - had better, would rather  
        > You had better leave.  
- Perfect Infinitive  
    to have + past participle  
    Indicates the action happened before the main verb.  
    > She seems to have forgotten the meeting.  
    > I would like to have seen the concert.  
- Continuous (Progressive) Infinitive  
    to be + present participle  
    Emphasizes ongoing action.  
    > He appears to be sleeping.  
    > She claims to be working on the project.  
- Passive Infinitive  
    to be + past participle  
    > The report needs to be submitted by Friday.  
    > He hopes to be invited to the party.  
- Perfect Passive Infinitive  
    to have been + past participle  
    > The house seems to have been abandoned for years.  

**Split Infinitives**  
A split infinitive occurs when an adverb or adverbial phrase is placed between "to" and the verb:  
> She decided to quickly leave.  

## Gerunds(动名词)  

A gerund is a verb form that ends in -ing and functions as a **noun** in a sentence.(Gerunds can do anything a noun can do)  

> Swimming is good exercise. (subject)  
> I enjoy reading. (direct object)  
> Her favorite hobby is painting. (subject complement)  
> She is afraid of flying. (object of a preposition)  
> His habit, biting his nails, annoys his mom. (Appositive(同位格) (renaming a noun))  

**Gerund with a Possessive (or Object) Noun/Pronoun**  
When a gerund has a "doer" (someone performing the action), we often use a possessive noun or pronoun before it:  
> I appreciate your helping me. ✅ (formal/correct)  
> I appreciate you helping me. ✅ (common in informal speech)  
> His singing was amazing. ✅ (formal/correct)	  
> He singing was amazing. ✅ (common in informal speech)  
> Do you mind my opening the window? ✅ (formal/correct)  
> Do you mind me opening the window? ✅ (common in informal speech)  

**Verbs That Are Followed by Gerunds (Not Infinitives)**  
Some verbs almost always take a gerund as their object.  
> They’re considering moving abroad.  
> He suggested taking a break.  
> Do you mind waiting?  

**Gerund After Prepositions**  
> She’s interested in learning Spanish.  
> He succeeded by working hard.  
> They argued about moving to a new city.  
> Thank you for helping me.  

**Gerund vs. Present Participle**  
- Gerund  
    Acts as a noun  
    > Swimming is fun. (noun)
- Present Participle  
    Acts as an adjective or part of a verb tense
    > The barking dog woke me up. (adjective)  
    > She is running now. (present continuous)  

**Gerund vs. Infinitive**  
Some verbs can take either a gerund or an infinitive, but the meaning may change.  
- Same Meaning  
    like, love, hate, prefer, begin, start, continue  
    > I like to swim. = I like swimming.  
    > She started to cry. = She started crying.  
- Different Meaning  
    **remember**  
    > I remember locking the door. (I did it)  
    > Remember to lock the door! (future action)  

    **forget**  
    > I'll never forget meeting her. (implies you recall a past event)  
    > I forgot to call him. (you didn't do it)  

    **stop**  
    > He stopped smoking. (quit an activity)  
    > He stopped to smoke. (He paused his walk to have a cigarette)  

    **try**  
    > Try adding salt. (See if it helps. experiment with a solution)  
    > I tried to open the jar. (But I couldn't. make an effort)  

    **regret**  
    > I regret quitting my job. (feel sorry about a past action)  
    > We regret to inform you... (formal way to give bad news)  

**Common Gerund Phrases**  
> It’s no use crying over spilled milk.  
> There’s no point arguing with him.  
> Can’t help laughing  
> Waste time/money (on) doing something  
> Spend time doing something   
> Have difficulty/trouble (in) doing something  

**Negative Gerunds**  
To make a gerund negative, add not before it  
> I regret not studying harder.  
> She’s afraid of not passing the test.  
> Not knowing the rules caused problems.  

**Types of Gerunds**  
- Passive Gerund
    being + past participle 
    > She hates being interrupted.  
    > He complained about being overcharged.  
- Perfect Gerund  
    having + past participle  
    > She denied having stolen the money.  
    > He was praised for having saved the child.  
- Perfect Passive Gerund  
    having been + past participle  
    > He was accused of having been involved in the scandal.  

**Gerund form of “there is.”**  
The -ing form turns the clause into a noun phrase
> There is a problem. -> There being a problem  
> There is an error. -> There being an error  
> there’s no notion in the relational case of **there being** anything “between the DELETE and the INSERT”  

---

## Would Be / Verb 
- Hypothetical / Unreal Situations (Conditional)  
    if + past tense → would + base verb  
    > It would be nice if you came.  
- Polite Suggestions / Soft Opinions  
    > It would be better to wait.  
- Future in the Past  
    When reporting or narrating something that was in the future relative to a past time.  
    > He said he would be late.  
    > I knew it would be difficult.  
- Probability / Assumption  
    > That would be John at the door.  
- Preferences  
    Used to express a preference politely.  
    > I would be happy to help.  

## Relative Clause  
A relative modifies a noun — it works like a long adjective.   

**Common Relative Pronouns**  
| Pronoun   | Refers to                 | Function in Clause | Example                                      |
| --------- | ------------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| **who**   | people                    | subject or object  | The man **who helped me** is kind.           |
| **whom**  | people                    | object (formal)    | The man **whom I met** is kind.              |
| **whose** | possession                | —                  | The girl **whose bag was stolen** is crying. |
| **which** | things / animals          | subject or object  | The car **which broke down** was old.        |
| **that**  | people, things (informal) | subject or object  | The book **that I read** was good.           |
| **where** | place                     | —                  | The house **where I was born** is gone.      |
| **when**  | time                      | —                  | The day **when we met** was sunny.           |
| **why**   | reason                    | —                  | The reason **why I called** is simple.       |

**When You Can Omit the Relative Pronoun**  
You can omit it when it’s the **object** of the relative clause.  
> The book (that) I bought is good.  
> The man (who) I met was kind.  

**Prepositions in Relative Clauses**  
- Formal (with relative pronoun at front)  
    > The person to whom I spoke was kind.  
- Informal (move preposition to end)  
    > The person who I spoke to was kind.  

**Nominal(free) Relative Clause**  
A nominal relative clause = relative pronoun + clause, used as a **noun** in a sentence. 
Nominal relative clauses **can function in all noun positions**.   
> What you said is true.  
> I’m interested in what he does.  
It’s free (or nominal) because it doesn’t depend on an earlier noun, unlike an ordinary relative clause.  
It replaces the noun completely — acts as a noun clause.  

## Participle  
A participle is a verb form used as an **adjective (to describe a noun)** or as part of a verb phrase.  
- Present participle  
    -ing form  
    shows ongoing action or describes nouns  
- Past participle  
    usually -ed, -en, or irregular form  
    shows completed action or describes nouns  

**Uses of Participles**
- As part of a verb phrase  
- As adjectives  
    > The crying baby is hungry.  
    > The broken window needs repair.  
    It functions like a reduced relative clause  
    > The base table that is being created -> Reduced to “the base table being created.”  
- As adverbs  
    > It generally has two closely related meanings **depending on the context**.  
- As participial phrases  
    These describe or **add information about a noun or about the whole sentence**.  
    > Walking down the street, I saw a friend.  
    > Tired from work, he went straight to bed.  
    ⚠️ Important: The subject of the participial phrase must be the same as the subject of the main clause.  
- Absolute construction  
    independent phrase giving background information.  
    > Weather permitting, we’ll go out.  
- As Object Complements  
    > I caught him stealing.  
    ⚠️ Not all verbs can do this! Certain verbs of perception, discovery, or imagination can take this structure.  
    - Perception verbs (see, hear, watch, notice, feel, find, observe, smell, catch)  
        > “I saw him running.” / “We heard her singing.” / “I caught him cheating.”  
    - Discovery verbs (find, discover, leave, keep)  
        > “We found her crying.” / “He kept me waiting.”  
    - Causative verbs (have, get, keep) — slightly different nuance  
        > “She had me laughing all night.” / “He kept us waiting.”  
    ⚠️ The difference between “I saw him sing” (bare infinitive) and “I saw him singing” (present participle)  
    - bare infinitive  
        Whole, complete action  
        You saw the entire event from beginning to end.  
    - present participle
        Ongoing, partial action  
        You saw the person in the middle of the action, not necessarily the whole thing.  

**Gerund vs. Present Participle**  
Ask:  
→ “Is it being used as a thing (noun)?” → Gerund  
→ “Is it being used to describe something or as a tense?” → Participle  

## Prepositional phrase  
A prepositional phrase is a group of words that:  
- begins with a preposition (like in, on, at, by, with, from, about, after, before, etc.)  
- and ends with the **object of the preposition (a noun, pronoun, or noun phrase)**.  
> in the morning → “in” (preposition) + “the morning” (object)  

**Prepositional phrase functions**  
- As an Adjective Phrase  
    Noun + [Prepositional phrase] = expanded noun phrase.  
    Describes or gives more information about a noun.  
    > The book on the table is mine.  
- As an Adverb Phrase  
    Verb + [Prepositional phrase] = more detail about the action.  
    Describes where, when, how, or why something happens (modifies a verb).  
    > He spoke with great confidence.  
    > They left because of the rain.  
    Adverbs modify the entire clause  
    > Even for you, this task is difficult.  
- Complement roles  
    - Verb complement  
        Certain verbs require a prepositional phrase to complete their meaning.  
        > It depends on you.  
        > She listens to music.  
        Compare with adverbial prepositional phrase  
        - Verb complement  
            > It depends on you.  
            “on you” is **necessary for meaning**  
        - Adverbial  
            > I waited for an hour.  
            “for an hour” adds extra info but is **not required to understand the verb “waited”**  
    - Adjective complement  
        > She is afraid of spiders.  
        > I’m interested in music.  
    - Complement of a noun  
        > the question about grammar  
        > the destruction of the city  
    - Subject complement  
        > The book is on the table.  
        > He’s under pressure.  
    - Object complement  
        > They elected him as president.  
        > I regard her as a friend.  

## Object Complement  
An object complement is a word or phrase (noun, adjective, or infinitive ...) that comes after the direct object and gives more information about that object — it renames it or describes its state or result.  
- Noun  
    > They elected him **leader**.  
- Adjective  
    > They found her **tired**.  
- Bare infinitive  
    > We saw him **run**.  
- Participle  
    > I caught him **stealing**.  
    > She found her keys **lying on the table**.   
    > He got his car **fixed**.  

## Adjective Complement  
- Prepositional phrase  
    > She’s afraid **of spiders.**  
    > I’m interested **in learning.**  
- Nominal relative clause / Noun Clause  
    > I’m sure **(that) he’s right.**  
    > I’m not sure **where he went.**  
    > I am happy **that you are here**.  
- Infinitive clause  
    > I’m happy **to help.**  
- Gerund  
    > She’s busy **studying.**  

## Reduced Clauses  
A reduced clause is a shortened form of a full clause — some words (usually **the subject and/or auxiliary verb**) are omitted because the meaning is still clear from context.  
> If it is taken literally, the phrase makes no sense. -> If taken literally, the phrase makes no sense.  
> As it was noted in Chapter 4, this is true. -> As noted in Chapter 4, this is true.  

**Major Types of Reduced Clauses**  
- Reduced Relative Clauses  
    > Students who are studying hard will pass. -> Students studying hard will pass.  
    > The book that was written by Orwell is famous. -> The book written by Orwell is famous.  
- Reduced Adverbial Clauses  
    - Active Reduction  
        If **the adverbial clause’s subject = the main clause’s subject, and the verb is active**, → you can remove the subject and auxiliary, and make the verb **-ing form**.  
        > After he finished his homework, he watched TV. -> After finishing his homework, he watched TV.  
    - Passive Reduction  
        If the clause is passive, you keep the past participle.  
        > As it was mentioned earlier, this is crucial. -> As mentioned earlier, this is crucial.  
        > When it is completed, the project will start. -> When completed, the project will start.  
    - Perfect Reduction  
        If the action in the adverbial clause happens **before** the action in the main clause, you can use **having + past participle**.  
        > Since they had seen the movie, they stayed home. -> Having seen the movie, they stayed home.  

## Adverbial Clauses  
A clause introduced by a **subordinating conjunction**, which cannot stand alone as a sentence and depends on a main clause. it functions like an **adverb**, modifying a verb, adjective, or whole clause.  
> I stayed home because it was raining.  

**Subordinating conjunctions**  
| Function / Meaning        | Common Subordinating Conjunctions             | Example                                     |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Time**                  | when, while, before, after, since, until      | “I left **after she arrived**.”             |
| **Cause / Reason**        | because, since, as                            | “I’m late **because the bus was late**.”    |
| **Condition**             | if, unless, provided that, in case            | “I’ll call you **if I’m free**.”            |
| **Contrast / Concession** | although, though, even though, whereas, while | “**Although it rained**, we went hiking.”   |
| **Purpose / Result**      | so that, in order that                        | “I whispered **so that he wouldn’t hear**.” |
| **Place**                 | where, wherever                               | “Sit **where you like**.”                   |
| **Manner / Comparison**   | as, as if, as though                          | “He runs **as if he were in a race**.”      |

## Relative-like Clauses  
A relative-like clause is a clause that **modifies a noun or noun phrase** (like a relative/adjective clause) **but is introduced by words other than the classic relative pronouns**(it may use as, as if, as though, the way, the manner instead of standard relative pronouns).  
> I’ll start with the relational model as Codd originally defined it.  

## Comparative Clause  
A comparative clause is a subordinate clause introduced by a comparative word or phrase (like than, as … as, the more … the more, etc.) to complete a comparison.  

**Basic structure**  
[Main clause with a comparative word] + [Subordinate comparative clause]  
> She runs faster **than I do**.  
> He is as tall **as his brother is**.  

**Types of Comparative Clauses**  
- “than” clause  
    > She’s taller than I am.  
- “as … as” clause  
    > He’s as tall as I am.  
- Double comparative  
    > The more you study, the smarter you get.  

## Causative Verb Patterns  
- Make  
    "make" is forceful and does not use "to".  
    - Action: make + object + bare infinitive  
        > The teacher made the students write the essay.  
    - State: make + object + adjective/past participle  
        > His apology made the matter settled.  
- Let  
    It also uses a bare infinitive but is almost exclusively for actions, not states.  
    - Action: let + object + bare infinitive  
        > My parents don't let me stay out late.  
- Have  
    - Action (arranging/experiencing): have + object + bare infinitive  
        > I'll have my assistant call you.  
    - State/Passive  
        > I need to have my car repaired  
- Get  
    - Action (persuasion): get + object + to-infinitive  
        > How can I get my brother to clean his room?  
    - State/Passive (arranging): get + object + past participle  
        > I need to get my car repaired.  

## Prepositional Verb  
A prepositional verb is a combination of a verb + a preposition. Together, they create a link to a direct object. The verb usually keeps its original meaning, but it requires that specific preposition to connect to the noun that follows it.  

**Rules of Prepositional Verbs**  
- They are Inseparable  
    You cannot put the object between the verb and the preposition. The two words are glued together.  
    > I am listening to music. ✔️  
    > I am listening music to. ❌  
- They Must Have an Object  
- The Preposition is Fixed  
    English usually dictates exactly which preposition goes with which verb. There is often no logical reason for this; it must be memorized.  

**Common Examples**  
> I am waiting for a package.  
> He asked for a glass of water.  
> I need to talk to your manager.  
> I can't concentrate on my work.  
> Did you participate in the game?  

## Phrasal Verb  
A Phrasal Verb is a combination of a Verb + a Particle(technically functioning as an Adverb, like up, on, off).  
The most important thing about phrasal verbs is that they **create a completely new meaning**. The meaning of the phrase is usually different from the individual words.  
> give up  

**The difference between a Prepositional Verb and a Phrasal Verb**  
- The "Movement" Rule    
    - Phrasal Verbs are often SEPARABLE. You can put the object between the verb and the particle.  
        > Turn the light on.  
    - Prepositional Verbs are INSEPARABLE.  
- The "Pronoun" Rule  
    - Phrasal Verb: The pronoun MUST go in the middle.  
        > Turn it on. ✔️  
        > Turn on it. ❌  
    - Prepositional Verb: The pronoun MUST go at the end.  
        > Listen to it.  
- The Object Requirement  
    - Prepositional Verbs almost always require an object.  
    - Phrasal Verbs often do not need an object at all  

## Noun Clause  
A Noun Clause is a dependent clause that functions exactly like a single noun.  
> I know where you live.  

**The Markers (Starters)**  
- That (for statements/facts): I think that it is raining.  
- If / Whether (for Yes/No questions): I don't know if he is coming.  
- Wh- Words (for information questions): Who, What, Where, When, Why, How, Which, Whose.   

**Grammar Rules**  
- Word Order  
    > Tell me what you bought. ✔️  
    > Tell me what did you buy. ❌  
- The Subjunctive Mood(虚拟式)  
    After verbs of command, suggestion, or urgency (suggest, insist, recommend, demand), the verb in the noun clause must be in the base form (bare infinitive). This is called the Subjunctive.  
    > I suggest that he **leave** now.  
    > The doctor recommended that she **be** more active.  
- Whether  
    "Whether" is required in two spots  
    - After a preposition  
        > I am thinking about whether I should go. (NOT: about if).  
    - Before an infinitive  
        > I don't know whether to stay or go. (NOT: if to stay).  

**The difference between a Noun Clause and a Nominal Relative Clause**  
Noun Clause: Replaces a noun. / Relative Clause: Describes a noun.  
- I visited where you live.  
    Here, it is definitely a Nominal Relative Clause.  
    It allows you to substitute "where" with **"the place where."**  
- I wonder where you live.  
    Here, it is definitely a Noun Clause.  
    Because you are thinking about the question/answer. You cannot "wonder a place."  

## Wh-Infinitive Phrase (Interrogative Infinitive)  
A Wh-Infinitive Phrase is a grammatical structure that **combines a question word (Wh-word) with a to-infinitive verb**.  
It is a **shortened version of a noun clause involving obligation or possibility** (words like should, can, or could).  
Like a noun clause, the Wh-Infinitive functions as a noun.  
> I don't know what I should do. -> I don't know what to do.  
> Can you tell me how I can get there? -> Can you tell me how to get there?  

**Crucial Rules**  
- You cannot use "why" with an infinitive. You must use a full clause.  
    > I don't know why to leave. ❌  
    > I don't know why I should leave. ✔️  
- NO "If"  
    > I am deciding if to buy it. ❌  
    > I am deciding whether to buy it. ✔️  

**Who is doing the action?**  
Usually, the person doing the infinitive action is the Subject of the main sentence.  
    > I want to know how to drive. (I want to know, and I will drive).  
However, if there is an Indirect Object in the sentence, the hidden subject shifts to that Object.  
    > I told John where to go. (I told John where he (John) should go.)  
    > The teacher taught us how to write. (The teacher taught us how we should write.)  

## Noun Complement Clause (Appositive(同位格) Clause)  
A Noun Complement Clause is a clause that renames or defines the content of a noun.  
It doesn't tell you which noun (like an adjective does); it tells you what the noun is. Noun = Clause.  
> The belief **that the earth is flat** is dangerous.  
While "that" is the most common connector, Noun Complements can sometimes start with other words if the abstract noun implies a question.  
> The question **whether we should go** remains.  

**Difference from Relative Clause**  
- The Relative Clause (The Noun MUST have a role in that clause)  
    > The report **that he wrote** is false.  
- The Noun Complement Clause (The Noun has NO role in that clause)  
    > The report **that he stole money** is false.  

## Adverbial Nouns  
**The "Invisible Preposition" Rule**  
In English, certain nouns allow us to drop the preposition that usually comes before them.  
> Full Grammatical Logic: "You build your database [in] that way."  
> Spoken Reality: "You build your database that way."  

**Common Categories of Adverbial Nouns**  
- Time (Answering "When" or "How long")  
    > I studied [for] all night.  
- Distance/Measurement (Answering "How far" or "How much")  
    > We walked [for] five miles.  
- Place (Answering "Where")  
    > Let's go [to] home.  
- Manner (Answering "How")  
    > Don't look at me [in] that way.  

## Elliptical Clause  
- Adverbial Clauses  
    The Rule: You can omit the **Subject and the Verb "Be"** if:  
        - The Subject of the dependent clause is the same as the Subject of the main clause.  
        - The verb is a form of "to be" (am, is, are, was, were).  
    > While [he was] reading, he fell asleep.  
    > If [it is] possible, please send it today.  
    > Though [she was] tired, she kept working.  
    > Be careful when [you are] crossing the street.  
    If the subjects are different, you cannot omit.  
- Comparative Clauses  
    The Rule: You can omit the verb phrase if it repeats the main verb. You can sometimes omit the subject if it is abstract/generic.  
    > He runs as fast as I [run].  
    > She is taller than I [am].  
    > Fill out the form as [it is shown] in the example.  
- Relative Clauses  
    The Rule: You can omit the Relative Pronoun (who, which, that) and the Verb "Be" together.  
    > The man [who is] standing there is my boss.  
    > The ideas [which were] suggested by him were good.  
- Coordinate Clauses  
    This happens in compound sentences connected by and, but, or.  
    The Rule: If the verb is identical in both clauses, you can omit the verb in the second clause.  
    > John lives in New York, and Mary [lives] in London.  
- Verb Phrase Ellipsis  
    The Rule: You keep the Auxiliary Verb (do, have, will, be, can) and omit the rest of the predicate.  
    > Did you fix the database? -> I did [fix the database].  
    > I haven't seen the movie, but she has [seen the movie].  
    > You shouldn't do that. -> I know I shouldn't [do that].  
- Noun Clauses  
    The Rule: You can omit the conjunction "that" if the noun clause is the Direct Object of the verb.  
    > I think [that] it is true.  

## Phrasal Modals  
Phrasal Modals are fixed expressions that function like auxiliary verbs to express modal meanings (necessity, preference, probability, etc.).  
- Had better  
    Strong advice or warning. It implies that there will be negative consequences if the action is not taken.  
    > You had better leave before the rain starts.  
    > He’d better not be late again.  
- Would rather  
    Preference  
    > I would rather stay home than go out.  
    If you are speaking about someone else, the verb changes to the past tense.  
    > I would rather you stayed home.  
- Have got to  
    Necessity or obligation. It is very similar to "must" or "have to." This is more informal and emphatic than "have to."  
    > I have got to (I've got to) finish this paper tonight.  
- Be to (am to / is to / are to)  
    Formal obligation, official schedules, or destiny.  
    > Instruction/Order: You are to wait here until the manager arrives.  
    > Schedule: The Prime Minister is to visit Japan next week.  
    > Destiny: They said goodbye, never knowing they were to meet again years later.  
- Be supposed to  
    > Expectation/Rule: You are supposed to take off your shoes inside.  
    > Hearsay/Belief: This movie is supposed to be very scary. (People say it is scary).  
    Often implies that the expectation differs from reality  
- Be about to  
    Imminent future. Something will happen very soon  
    > I am about to leave; I'll call you back.  
    > She was about to cry when he interrupted her.  
- Be likely to / Be unlikely to  
    Probability  
    > The price is likely to rise.  
    > He is unlikely to accept the offer.  
- Be due to  
    Scheduled or expected at a specific time.  
    > The bus is due to arrive at 5:00.  
    > The baby is due to be born in May.  

## Extraposition  
Extraposition is a syntactic mechanism in English where a "heavy" or complex element is moved (extraposed) from its normal position to the end of the sentence.  
To fill the empty space left behind, we insert a dummy subject (usually "it").  
English generally dislikes heavy, long subjects at the start of a sentence. We prefer to get to the main verb quickly.  
- Subject Extraposition  
    It moves a subject clause to the end.  
    - To-Infinitives  
        > It is difficult to learn English.  
    - That-Clauses  
        > It is surprising that he failed the test.  
    - Wh-Clauses  
        > It is a mystery who stole the money.  
- Object Extraposition  
    This occurs with Complex Transitive Verbs **(verbs that take a direct object + an object complement)**, such as make, find, consider, think, believe.  
    Unlike Subject Extraposition (which is often optional), Object Extraposition is often mandatory  
    > Incorrect: I found [to solve the puzzle] easy.  
    > Correct: I found it easy [to solve the puzzle].  
    Subject: I  
    Verb: Found  
    Direct Object (Dummy): It  
    Object Complement: Easy  
    Real Direct Object: To solve the puzzle  
- Relative Clause    
    Sometimes, we move a relative clause away from the noun it modifies. This usually happens if the verb is very short.  
    > A man walked in **who was wearing a bright yellow suit**.  

## Complementizer  
## How to determine the correct article (indefinite or definite) and number (singular or plural) for a noun in a sentence  
- Is the noun Countable or Uncountable?  
    Countable Nouns: They have both singular and plural forms.  
    Uncountable Nouns: They usually only have a singular form and cannot use "a" or "an."  
- Is the noun Specific or General?  
    - Specific (Definite)  Use "THE"  
        Use The when the listener knows exactly which specific item you are talking about.  
        > Mentioned before: "I saw a dog. The dog was barking."  
        > Unique (Only one exists): "The sun," "The President."  
        > Defined by context: "Close the door." (The specific door in this room).  
        "The" works for Singular, Plural, and Uncountable nouns.  
    - General (Indefinite) Use "A/AN" or "Zero Article"  
        Use these when talking about something for the first time, or when talking about any member of a group, not a specific one.  
        > Singular Countable: Use A/An. ("I need a pen." - Any pen will do).  
        > Plural Countable: Use No Article (Zero Article). ("I like cats." - Cats in general).  
        > Uncountable: Use No Article. ("I need water." - Some amount of water).  
- Singular vs. Plural  
    When making general statements about a whole category (Generalizations), you often have a choice, but the meaning changes slightly.  
    - The "Zero Plural" (Most Common)  
        Use the Plural form with No Article. This is the most natural way to talk about things in general.  
        > Dogs are loyal animals.  
    - The "Representative Singular"  
        Use A/An with a Singular noun. This treats one item as a representative of the whole group.  
        > A dog is a loyal animal. (Meaning: Any dog you find will be loyal)  
    - The "Scientific Singular"  
        Use The with a Singular noun. This is formal and used mostly in biology or technical fields to describe a species or invention.  
        > The tiger is in danger of extinction. (The species, not one specific tiger).  

## The way to distinguish between complements and adjuncts.    
- The "Content" vs. "Aboutness" Distinction  
    The strongest test for a Noun Complement is **whether the phrase defines the content of the noun (what the noun is) or just the topic (what the noun is about)**.  
    - Complement  
        > The question **of whether we should leave** is difficult.  
        The text in bold is the question itself.  
    - Modifier (Adjunct)  
        > I have a question regarding your email.  
        The phrase "regarding your email" is not the question itself. The actual question might be "When did you send it?" or "Did you attach the file?"  
- The Omission Test  
    Complements are often required to make the sentence grammatical or to keep the meaning of the head word intact. Adjuncts can be removed without "breaking" the sentence.  
    - Complement: The phrase is required by the verb or noun.  
        > He put the book on the table.  
    - Adjunct: The phrase is optional.  
        > He read the book on the table.  
- The Iteration (Stacking) Test  
    You can stack as many adjuncts as you want, but you usually can only have one complement (per semantic argument).  
    - Complements  
        > The student of physics of chemistry. -- 2 Complements = Wrong  
        You must use a conjunction: "The student of physics and chemistry."  
    - Adjuncts  
        > I saw the man in the park on Tuesday with a telescope.  
- Semantic Selection  
    Complements are "licensed" (allowed/required) by the specific meaning of the head word. Adjuncts are free agents.  
    - Complement: The word rely requires an "on" phrase. The word wonder requires a question clause. The specific preposition is often dictated by the head (e.g., "fond of," "reliant on").  
        An adjunct can usually use many different prepositions depending on the meaning (location, time, manner), but a complement uses a specific preposition demanded by the verb.  
        > He wasted time on the game. Because the verb "waste" dictates that you must use "on" to describe the activity, the phrase is tightly bound to the verb. Therefore, it is a complement.  
    - Adjunct: The phrase "in the morning" can be applied to cooking, running, sleeping, dying, singing, etc. The head word doesn't care; the adjunct adds meaning regardless of the head.

## Dictionary Website
### LMArena
I want to build a dictionary website powered by Gemini-3-Pro. This website should explain words, phrases, and idioms in simple, easy-to-understand English. When any word within an explanation is clicked, it should link to that word's own explanation. Clicking on such a text link should open it in a new browser window. For individual words, the website should provide a phonetic transcription, an audio pronunciation button, and explanations of all possible meanings with several real examples. For phrases or idioms, it should explain their meaning with several practical examples and clarify why they are used in that particular way. For sentences containing words surrounded by asterisks (*like this*), the website should explain their meaning within that specific context. Additionally, I want to include a new feature that will correct grammar errors, incorrect expressions, and unnatural phrasing in user-provided text, and then explain these changes in detail.
